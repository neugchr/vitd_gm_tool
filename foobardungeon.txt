Oubliette - The floor of this room is a steep and sleek funnel that leads to a single hole just large enough for a mortal to slip into. Walking across this room is difficult, save versus Breath or slide into the hole and drop 1d6x10 feet. The pit is never empty...

Charnel House - Skulls and remains have been carefully stacked on the plinths, names and epitaphs scratched into them. Some are ancient...

Tower - A vertical chimney travels up to frightful heights, the ceiling of which is beyond sight. Echoes seem to linger in the dark space far above. This room leads to the surface if it appears at a Depth greater than 1, otherwise it leads to nowhere except a ceiling hundreds of feet up.There is a 2-in-6 chance the tower has something akin to stairs, otherwise it must be scaled with some difficulty.
The once smooth surface of the tower has been eroded by time. Enabeling explorers to climb it with some difficulty.
